<h3>Risks and barriers of AI</h3>
<BR>
<BR>
<h4>Data availability:</h4> Often,data is presented in isolation across companies or is inconsistent and of low quality,
 presenting a significant challenge for companies seeking to create value from AI at scale.<BR> In order to overcome this barrier,
 it will be vital to draw up a clear strategy from the outset so thatAI data can be extracted in an organized and consistent manner.
<BR>
<h4>Lack of qualified professionals:</h4> Another obstacle that often occurs at the business level for the adoption of AI is the scarcity of profiles with skills and experience in this type of implementations.
<BR> It is crucial in these cases to have professionals who have already worked on projects of the same magnitude.
<BR>
<h4>The cost and implementation time of AI projects</h4> The cost of implementation, both at the time and the economic level, is a very important factor in choosing to execute this type of project.
<BR> Companies that lack internal skills or are not familiar with AI systems,
 must value the outsourcing of both implementation and maintenance in order to obtain successful results in their project
