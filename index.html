<h3>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h3>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
According to the father of Artificial Intelligence, John McCarthy,<BR> it is " The science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs".<BR>

Artificial Intelligence is a way of making a computer, a computer-controlled robot, or a software think intelligently, <BR>in the similar manner the intelligent humans think.

AI is accomplished by studying how human brain thinks,<BR> and how humans learn, decide, and work while trying to solve a problem, and then using the outcomes of this study as a basis of developing intelligent software and systems.
